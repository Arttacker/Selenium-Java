# Selenium-Java Automation Test Repository

Welcome to the Selenium-Java Automation Test Repository! This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for beginners looking to dive into test automation using Selenium with Java. Whether you're new to automation testing or looking to enhance your skills, this repository provides a solid foundation to get started.

## About Selenium, JUnit, TestNG, and Java

[Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) is a powerful open-source tool widely used for automating web browsers. With its robust features and flexibility, Selenium enables testers to automate web applications for testing purposes efficiently.

[JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/) and [TestNG](https://testng.org/doc/) are popular testing frameworks for Java that provide annotations, assertions, and other utilities to simplify the testing process and enhance test case organization.

[Java](https://www.java.com/) is a popular programming language known for its versatility and platform independence. It's widely used in the automation testing domain due to its readability, maintainability, and extensive community support.

## Getting Started

To begin your journey with Selenium and Java automation testing, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning or downloading this repository to your local machine.

2. **Setup Environment**: Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) and your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) installed. We recommend using IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse for Java development. Before running your tests, ensure that the dependencies listed in the `pom.xml` file are up to date. These dependencies include:

```xml
<dependencies>

    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.seleniumhq.selenium</groupId>
        <artifactId>selenium-java</artifactId>
        <version>4.20.0</version>
    </dependency>

    <dependency>
        <groupId>junit</groupId>
        <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
        <version>4.13.2</version>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>

    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.testng</groupId>
        <artifactId>testng</artifactId>
        <version>7.10.1</version>
    </dependency>

</dependencies>
```

Before running your tests, ensure that these dependencies are up to date by checking for any newer versions available. You can do this either manually or by using dependency management tools like Maven. Keeping dependencies up to date ensures compatibility and leverages the latest features and improvements.

3. **Install Selenium WebDriver**: Install Selenium WebDriver in your project. You can use tools like Maven or Gradle to manage dependencies efficiently.

4. **Write Your First Test**: Explore the `src/test/java` directory to find sample test scripts. Start by running these scripts to understand how Selenium interacts with web elements.

5. **Customize and Experiment**: Experiment with different locators, actions, and assertions to understand Selenium's capabilities thoroughly.

## Repository Structure

This repository follows a standard structure for organizing Selenium-Java test scripts:

- **src/main/java**: Contains main Java source files.
- **src/test/java**: Houses test scripts written in Java for Selenium automation.
- **src/test/resources**: Includes resources such as test data, configuration files, etc.
